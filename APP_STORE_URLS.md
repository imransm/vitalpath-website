# App Store URLs

Use these URLs in App Store Connect:

## Current URLs (GitHub Pages)

- **Privacy Policy URL**: `https://imransm.github.io/vitalpath-website/privacy.html`
- **Support URL**: `https://imransm.github.io/vitalpath-website/support.html`

## Adding to App Store Connect

1. Go to: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
2. Select your app → App Information
3. Add Privacy Policy URL: `https://imransm.github.io/vitalpath-website/privacy.html`
4. Add Support URL: `https://imransm.github.io/vitalpath-website/support.html`
5. Save changes

## Custom Domain (Future - Optional)

If you decide to purchase `vitalpath.app` (or another domain) later:

1. Buy the domain from Namecheap, Google Domains, or any registrar
2. Add CNAME file to repository: `vitalpath.app`
3. Configure DNS records at your registrar
4. Enable custom domain in GitHub Pages settings
5. Update URLs in App Store Connect

**Note**: You can change URLs in App Store Connect at any time, even after submission.

## Testing

Verify both URLs work:
- ✅ https://imransm.github.io/vitalpath-website/privacy.html
- ✅ https://imransm.github.io/vitalpath-website/support.html

Both should load correctly with your privacy policy and support pages.
